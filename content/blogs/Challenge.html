<h2>GDP Compononents over time in Nordic Countries</h2>
<p>This site is used to look at GDP components over time in the nordic countries.</p>
<p>We will breakdown GDP into the main components of Consumption C, Investment I, Government spending G, and Net Exports.</p>
<p>First we want to load the dataset for GDP in R. The dataset goes back to 1970 for all countries and with each GDP component.</p>
<p>The dataset can be loaded with the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>UN_GDP_data  &lt;-  read_excel(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xlsx&quot;), # Excel filename
                sheet=&quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr&quot;, # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip</code></pre>
<p>First we want to tidy the data so that it is easier to work with going forward.</p>
<p>The data is in absolute numbers and we want an easier smaller format to work with so we will divide by 1bn.</p>
<p>Also we wanna filter for the variables we need and rename these to something more logical.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Loading the dataset
tidy_GDP_data  &lt;-  UN_GDP_data %&gt;% #Original Dataset
    
#Converting to a long format to make it easier to work with
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, #Years 1970-2017
               names_to = &quot;Year&quot;, #Name of new column with row titles
               values_to = &quot;USD&quot;) %&gt;% #Name of column with value inputs
  
  #We want to convert to USDbn to make the file more readable
 mutate(USDbn = USD/1e9) %&gt;% #Notice that dividing by 1e9 is the same as 1bn (scientific format)
  
  #Next we filter for the variables we need. Here it is important to us %in% (one of the filters or more need to hold true) instead of == (all of filters need to be true) 
 filter(IndicatorName %in% c(&quot;Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)&quot;, #Our C
                             &quot;General government final consumption expenditure&quot;, #our G
                             &quot;Gross capital formation&quot;, #Our I
                             &quot;Exports of goods and services&quot;, #Our Exports
                             &quot;Imports of goods and services&quot;, #Our Imoorts
                             &quot;Gross Domestic Product (GDP)&quot;)) %&gt;% #We also wanna get total GDP which will be useful for comparison later in the process
  
  #Filtering out unneccessary columns for efficiency
  select(Country, IndicatorName, Year, USDbn) %&gt;% #Choosing Country, Category, Year, and Amount as our key variables
  
  #Renaming the variables to something more readable
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(
    IndicatorName == &quot;Imports of goods and services&quot; ~ &quot;Imports&quot;, #Renaming Imports
    IndicatorName == &quot;Exports of goods and services&quot; ~ &quot;Exports&quot;, #Renaming Exports
    IndicatorName == &quot;Gross capital formation&quot; ~ &quot;Gross capital formation&quot;, #Investment is not renamed but an input is still needed (otherwise it will be NA)
    IndicatorName == &quot;General government final consumption expenditure&quot; ~ &quot;Government Expenditure&quot;, #Renaming Government Expenditure
    IndicatorName == &quot;Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)&quot; ~ &quot;Household consumption&quot;, #Renaming Consumption
    IndicatorName == &quot;Gross Domestic Product (GDP)&quot; ~ &quot;GDP&quot;)) #Renaming GDP

#We glimse this to get an overview of the converted dataset. Below we see that it looks simple and structured

<p>With our data in tidy format let’s plot some overviews.</p>
<p>We wanna produce a plot of Denmark, Sweden and Norway over time to see GDP development for each category.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Let us choose our dataset
tidy_GDP_data_GDPestimate &lt;- tidy_GDP_data %&gt;%

#Renaming as it will be more efficient to work with shorter easy to read names    
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(
    IndicatorName == &quot;Imports&quot; ~ &quot;Im&quot;,
    IndicatorName == &quot;Exports&quot; ~ &quot;Ex&quot;,
    IndicatorName == &quot;Gross capital formation&quot; ~ &quot;I&quot;,
    IndicatorName == &quot;Government Expenditure&quot; ~ &quot;G&quot;,
    IndicatorName == &quot;Household consumption&quot; ~ &quot;C&quot;,
    IndicatorName == &quot;GDP&quot; ~ &quot;GDP&quot;)) %&gt;%

#To compute total GDP we can widen the table
pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, #Widen by indicator name
            values_from = USDbn) %&gt;%  #Values to be taken from the USDbn amount
  
  #Lets calculate the required variables
  mutate(Net_Ex = Ex-Im, #Net Exports
         GDPestimate = Net_Ex + I + G + C, #Estimated total GDP from our variables
         GDPpercent_diff = GDPestimate/GDP) #Difference between our estimated GDP and actual GDP (stated in percent of Actual GDP)</code></pre>
<p>We compute such a graph in the following way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#First let us work with our dataset
tidy_GDP_data_GDPpercent &lt;- tidy_GDP_data_GDPestimate %&gt;% 
  
  #Lets filter for the countries we need
    filter(Country %in% c(&quot;Denmark&quot;, &quot;Sweden&quot;, &quot;Norway&quot;)) %&gt;% #US, Ger, India
  
  #And Lets calculate the percentage each variable is of our estimated GDP which will add to 100
  mutate(C_per = C/GDPestimate, #C in percent
         G_per = G/GDPestimate, #G in percent
         I_per = I/GDPestimate, #I in Percent
         Net_Ex_per = Net_Ex/GDPestimate) %&gt;% #Net Exports in Percent
  
  #Next let us select only the variables we need from our dataframe.
  select(Country, Year, C_per, G_per, I_per, Net_Ex_per) %&gt;%  #In this case we need the percentage estimates, year, and Country
  
  #To make it easier to work with the data we convert it back into long format
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:6, #Columns to be converted
               names_to = &quot;IndicatorName&quot;, #Name of new Column with variable names
               values_to = &quot;GDPpercent&quot;) %&gt;% #Name of new column with Values
  
  #Now let us rename to something more readable for the chart
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when( #Case when to say that when x holds true use y 
    IndicatorName == &quot;Net_Ex_per&quot; ~ &quot;Net Exports&quot;,

    IndicatorName == &quot;G_per&quot; ~ &quot;Government Expenditure&quot;,
    IndicatorName == &quot;C_per&quot; ~ &quot;Household consumption&quot;),
    
    #We want to reorder these factors according to the order in the above image
    IndicatorName = factor(IndicatorName, #Ordering by indicator name
                                levels = c(
                                  &quot;Government Expenditure&quot;,

ggplot(tidy_GDP_data_GDPpercent, 
       aes(x = Year, #Year on x axis
           y = GDPpercent, #GDP on y axis
           group = IndicatorName, #To tell R we are working with indicator variables so it can seperate the datapoints

<p>We see that a couple of key things from this chart.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the basic structure of GDP is very similar across very different countries. Here we used Denmark, Sweden, and Nowray but it is always the case that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Net exports has the smallest impact on GDP</li>
<li>Household Consumption is the most important factor</li>
<li>Government spending and Investment are similar in importance</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some exceptions to the above which are likely driven by the countries:</p>
<p><strong>Denmark:</strong> In Denmark the importance of exports has been increasing and exports has the relatively highest importance of the three countries. The country is known for exporting medicine, pork and more.</p>
<p><strong>Norway:</strong> Norway say a sudden spike in exports in early 2000’s likely from their large oil reservoirs.</p>
<p><strong>Sweden:</strong> Government expenditure has been of decreasing importance the latest years</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Choosing variables

<p>WE see that in overall terms the trend and relative importance of each category have looked very similar from 1970 until today.</p>
