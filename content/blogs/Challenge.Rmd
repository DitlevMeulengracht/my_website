## GDP Compononents over time in Nordic Countries

This site is used to look at GDP components over time in the nordic countries. 

We will breakdown GDP into the main components of Consumption C, Investment I, Government spending G, and Net Exports. 

First we want to load the dataset for GDP in R. The dataset goes back to 1970 for all countries and with each GDP component. 

The dataset can be loaded with the following code:


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xlsx"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

First we want to tidy the data so that it is easier to work with going forward. 

The data is in absolute numbers and we want an easier smaller format to work with so we will divide by 1bn.

Also we wanna filter for the variables we need and rename these to something more logical. 


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

#Loading the dataset
tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% #Original Dataset
    
#Converting to a long format to make it easier to work with
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, #Years 1970-2017
               names_to = "Year", #Name of new column with row titles
               values_to = "USD") %>% #Name of column with value inputs
  
  #We want to convert to USDbn to make the file more readable
 mutate(USDbn = USD/1e9) %>% #Notice that dividing by 1e9 is the same as 1bn (scientific format)
  
  #Next we filter for the variables we need. Here it is important to us %in% (one of the filters or more need to hold true) instead of == (all of filters need to be true) 
 filter(IndicatorName %in% c("Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)", #Our C
                             "General government final consumption expenditure", #our G
                             "Gross capital formation", #Our I
                             "Exports of goods and services", #Our Exports
                             "Imports of goods and services", #Our Imoorts
                             "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)")) %>% #We also wanna get total GDP which will be useful for comparison later in the process
  
  #Filtering out unneccessary columns for efficiency
  select(Country, IndicatorName, Year, USDbn) %>% #Choosing Country, Category, Year, and Amount as our key variables
  
  #Renaming the variables to something more readable
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(
    IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports", #Renaming Imports
    IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports", #Renaming Exports
    IndicatorName == "Gross capital formation" ~ "Gross capital formation", #Investment is not renamed but an input is still needed (otherwise it will be NA)
    IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government Expenditure", #Renaming Government Expenditure
    IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household consumption", #Renaming Consumption
    IndicatorName == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" ~ "GDP")) #Renaming GDP

#We glimse this to get an overview of the converted dataset. Below we see that it looks simple and structured
glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


```

With our data in tidy format let's plot some overviews. 

We wanna produce a plot of Denmark, Sweden and Norway over time to see GDP development for each category.


```{r}
#Let us choose our dataset
tidy_GDP_data_GDPestimate <- tidy_GDP_data %>%

#Renaming as it will be more efficient to work with shorter easy to read names    
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(
    IndicatorName == "Imports" ~ "Im",
    IndicatorName == "Exports" ~ "Ex",
    IndicatorName == "Gross capital formation" ~ "I",
    IndicatorName == "Government Expenditure" ~ "G",
    IndicatorName == "Household consumption" ~ "C",
    IndicatorName == "GDP" ~ "GDP")) %>%

#To compute total GDP we can widen the table
pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, #Widen by indicator name
            values_from = USDbn) %>%  #Values to be taken from the USDbn amount
  
  #Lets calculate the required variables
  mutate(Net_Ex = Ex-Im, #Net Exports
         GDPestimate = Net_Ex + I + G + C, #Estimated total GDP from our variables
         GDPpercent_diff = GDPestimate/GDP) #Difference between our estimated GDP and actual GDP (stated in percent of Actual GDP)


```

We compute such a graph in the following way:

```{r fig.width=15, fig.height=10}

#First let us work with our dataset
tidy_GDP_data_GDPpercent <- tidy_GDP_data_GDPestimate %>% 
  
  #Lets filter for the countries we need
    filter(Country %in% c("Denmark", "Sweden", "Norway")) %>% #US, Ger, India
  
  #And Lets calculate the percentage each variable is of our estimated GDP which will add to 100
  mutate(C_per = C/GDPestimate, #C in percent
         G_per = G/GDPestimate, #G in percent
         I_per = I/GDPestimate, #I in Percent
         Net_Ex_per = Net_Ex/GDPestimate) %>% #Net Exports in Percent
  
  #Next let us select only the variables we need from our dataframe.
  select(Country, Year, C_per, G_per, I_per, Net_Ex_per) %>%  #In this case we need the percentage estimates, year, and Country
  
  #To make it easier to work with the data we convert it back into long format
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:6, #Columns to be converted
               names_to = "IndicatorName", #Name of new Column with variable names
               values_to = "GDPpercent") %>% #Name of new column with Values
  
  #Now let us rename to something more readable for the chart
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when( #Case when to say that when x holds true use y 
    IndicatorName == "Net_Ex_per" ~ "Net Exports",
    IndicatorName == "I_per" ~ "Gross capital formation",
    IndicatorName == "G_per" ~ "Government Expenditure",
    IndicatorName == "C_per" ~ "Household consumption"),
    
    #We want to reorder these factors according to the order in the above image
    IndicatorName = factor(IndicatorName, #Ordering by indicator name
                                levels = c(
                                  "Government Expenditure",
                                  "Gross capital formation",
                                  "Household consumption",
                                  "Net Exports")))

#Now we are ready to plot the data. This initial Section is the same as the one used in the previous chart
ggplot(tidy_GDP_data_GDPpercent, 
       aes(x = Year, #Year on x axis
           y = GDPpercent, #GDP on y axis
           group = IndicatorName, #To tell R we are working with indicator variables so it can seperate the datapoints
           color = IndicatorName)) + #To color by indicator
  
  #Plot type
  geom_line() + 
  
  #Seperating factor for each Chart
  facet_wrap(~Country) + 
  
  #Simplifying theme
  theme_economist() + 
  
  #Choosing x axis breaks
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(from = 1970, to = 2010, by = 10)) + 
  
  #Inserting labels
  labs(title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars", 
       subtitle ="In constant 2010 US$",
       y = "Proportion",
       caption = "Source: United Nations, https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads") +
  
  #Removing Titles
    theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), #This removes the x axis title
          legend.title = element_blank(),#This removes the legend title
          legend.position = "right") + 
  NULL


```

We see that a couple of key things from this chart. 

First and foremost, the basic structure of GDP is very similar across very different countries. Here we used Denmark, Sweden, and Nowray but it is always the case that:

- Net exports has the smallest impact on GDP
- Household Consumption is the most important factor
- Government spending and Investment are similar in importance


However, there are some exceptions to the above which are likely driven by the countries: 

**Denmark:** In Denmark the importance of exports has been increasing and exports has the relatively highest importance of the three countries. The country is known for exporting medicine, pork and more. 

**Norway:** Norway say a sudden spike in exports in early 2000's likely from their large oil reservoirs. 

**Sweden:** Government expenditure has been of decreasing importance the latest years





```{r fig.width=15, fig.height=10}
#Choosing variables
ggplot(tidy_GDP_data_GDPpercent, aes(x = IndicatorName, y = GDPpercent, fill = IndicatorName)) + 
  
  #IN Boxplot
  geom_boxplot() + 
  
  #By Country
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  
  #Simple Theme
  theme_economist() + 
  
  #Flipping Coordinates
  coord_flip() + 
  
  #Adding Labels
  labs(title = "Weight of GDP variables from 1970 to today",
       subtitle = "in constant 2010 USD$",
       x = "GDP Variable", 
       y = "Weight in %") + 
  
  
  #Removing Legend
  guides(fill = F) + 
  
  NULL 
```


WE see that in overall terms the trend and relative importance of each category have looked very similar from 1970 until today.
