## Interactive map of power generating capacity

We have borrowed the database from [World Resource Institute](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase) to find the location of all the world's powerplants!

```{r load_data, include=FALSE}
power_capacity <- read_csv(here::here("data", "global_power_plant_database.csv"))
```

### All power plants

Below codechunk is used to map all the world's power plants!

Hover to see the capacity in **MW** and click to see the **Fuel Type**


```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
			
#Map of the power plants around the world
power_capacity %>% 
  
  #Using Leaflet
  leaflet() %>% 
  
  #Maps from openstreet.map
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  
  #Using circles showing name and fuel
  addAwesomeMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   popup = ~primary_fuel,
                   label = ~capacity_mw,
                   clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()
                   )
```

### Top 10 biggest plants

However, there is a lof of information in the above. Did you know the 10 largest power stations in the world?

Let's find them! 

```{r fig.width=15, fig.height=10}
#Below chunk sorts and cuts out the 10 largest power plants.
power_capacity_top10 <- power_capacity %>% 
  arrange(desc(capacity_mw)) %>% 
  slice(1:10)
```


Feel free to explore the map below!

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
			
#Map of the power plants around the world
power_capacity_top10 %>% 
  
  #Using Leaflet
  leaflet() %>% 
  
  #Maps from openstreet.map
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  
  #Using circles showing name and fuel
  addAwesomeMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   popup = ~primary_fuel,
                   label = ~capacity_mw,
                   clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()
                   )
```


The biggest is the Three Gorges Dam in China with 22,500 GW!


For reference, here is the top power generating technologies as of 2017:

```{r fig.width=15, fig.height=10}

#Reordering and summarizing total capacity by Fuel Type
power_capacity_total <-  power_capacity %>% 
  
  #Grouping by Fuel
  group_by(primary_fuel) %>% 
  
  #Summarizing by capacity
  summarize(total_GW = sum(capacity_mw)/1000) %>% 
  
  #Arranging by total GW
  arrange(desc(total_GW))


#Plotting 
ggplot(power_capacity_total, aes(x = reorder(primary_fuel, total_GW), y = total_GW, fill = primary_fuel)) + 
  
  #In columns
  geom_col() + 
  
  #Choosing Theme
  theme_economist() + 
  
  #Flipping Axis
  coord_flip() + 
  
  #Removing legend
  guides(fill =F) + 
  
  #Adding labels
  labs(title = "World power generating capacity by Technology",
       subtitle = "Gas, Coal, And Hydro make up the majority of power generating capacity", 
       y = "World generating capacity in GW",
       x = "Fuel") +
  
  NULL

```
