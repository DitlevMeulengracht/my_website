## [Vauxhall East](https://www.vauxeast.co.uk)

[Vauxhall East](https://www.vauxeast.co.uk) provides a nice atmosphere and great open gym with plenty of room for climbers.

Furthermore, the gym has a nice setup utilizing the middle of the gym for competition boulders. 

It's an interesting setup which ensures the space does not feel cramped and makes for great climbing!

## [Westway](https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/westway-sports-fitness-centre/climbing/) 

[Westway](https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/westway-sports-fitness-centre/climbing/)  is a great option because they include both lead and top-rope climbing.

Although their bouldering section is smaller this makes it worth the effort for boulderers ready to try something different. 
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/WW.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```



## [Vauxhall West](https://www.vauxwest.co.uk)

[Vauxhall West](https://www.vauxwest.co.uk) has a LOT of routes which is good for climbers who want to do intense training. 

The downside of this gym is that it is split up in four sections making it feel quite cramped if there is a lot of people
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}

```




## [West 1 Climbing Wall](https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/seymour-leisure-centre/climbing-wall/)

[West 1 Climbing Wall](https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/seymour-leisure-centre/climbing-wall/) is quite private and does provide some freedom for solo sessions. 

The downside here is the gym is quite small and rarely has new routes. 

There is also toproping for those who wish to do that.
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}

## [Swiss Cottage Climbing Centre](https://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/london/camden/swiss-cottage-leisure-centre/f93e42c8-29dc-4dab-97df-e50b63219de3)

[Swiss Cottage Climbing Centre](https://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/london/camden/swiss-cottage-leisure-centre/f93e42c8-29dc-4dab-97df-e50b63219de3) iis the smallest of the gyms and currently closed. 

The gym is cheaper for those who wish to save money.
