<h2><a href="https://www.vauxeast.co.uk">Vauxhall East</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.vauxeast.co.uk">Vauxhall East</a> provides a nice atmosphere and great open gym with plenty of room for climbers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the gym has a nice setup utilizing the middle of the gym for competition boulders.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s an interesting setup which ensures the space does not feel cramped and makes for great climbing!</p>

<div id="westway" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/westway-sports-fitness-centre/climbing/">Westway</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/westway-sports-fitness-centre/climbing/">Westway</a> is a great option because they include both lead and top-rope climbing.</p>
<p>Although their bouldering section is smaller this makes it worth the effort for boulderers ready to try something different.</p>

<div id="vauxhall-west" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="https://www.vauxwest.co.uk">Vauxhall West</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.vauxwest.co.uk">Vauxhall West</a> has a LOT of routes which is good for climbers who want to do intense training.</p>
<p>The downside of this gym is that it is split up in four sections making it feel quite cramped if there is a lot of people</p>

<div id="west-1-climbing-wall" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/seymour-leisure-centre/climbing-wall/">West 1 Climbing Wall</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.everyoneactive.com/centre/seymour-leisure-centre/climbing-wall/">West 1 Climbing Wall</a> is quite private and does provide some freedom for solo sessions.</p>
<p>The downside here is the gym is quite small and rarely has new routes.</p>
<p>There is also toproping for those who wish to do that.</p>
