# Introduction

This section is used to highlight a few of my experiences at LBS in pictures! 


## Friend Group

Usually this is the people i hang out with at LBS! 
I'm the guy **2nd from the right!**
  
```{r Friends, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Friend_Group.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```

## Activities

We have been up for a bunch of activities since we got here! 

We have been going to carnevals!
  
```{r Carnival, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Carnival.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```

And Jazz Clubs!
  
```{r Jazz, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Jazz_club.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```

We even helped the community by planting flowers in a local garden!
  
```{r Plants, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Plant.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```

And have gone for long runs in Regent's Park!
  
```{r Run, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Run.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```

## School

We've also had to do quite a bit of studying...

Our current courses are:

- **Data Analytics**
- **Investment Fundamentals**
- **Financial Statement Analysis**

This website was created as part of the **Data Analytics** assignments!


We've have plent of time in school!

```{r School, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/School.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```

Tried to figure out complicated RStudio Graphs in GGplot!

```{r Graphs, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Graphs.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```

And planned how to work on projects!

```{r Planning, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Planning.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```

Luckily we have a good study group!

```{r Study, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Study_Grp.jpeg",error =FALSE)
```
